<p> This is after we have integrated Jenkins with Ansible. Ansible pushes a Docker Image into the Dockerhub through playbook1 and then makes DockerHost-server pull that image from the DockerHub and build the image to run a container. It exposes port 8082. </p>
<p> This is after we have launched Kubernetes in EKS with 3 pods on 2 nodes. Ansible-server should build and push an image into dockerhub. This image will then be pulled by Bootstrap ec2 server and launches a Kubernetes cluster with the image on port 8080. The kubernetes is exposed through a Load Balance. </p>
<p> The CI job is integrated with the CD job in jenkins such that after CI, CD job runs automatically. Moreover, CI job is run thru a Poll SCM every minute. </p>
